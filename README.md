About me.My first specialty is the organization and management of production. I managed a large branch of the company, sending 1500 - 3500 parcels a day. Of course, I had to do analytics of shipments and financial indicators. It is interesting for me to work as an analyst with professionals, because I am interested in this process and I can see the real picture behind the indicators.
